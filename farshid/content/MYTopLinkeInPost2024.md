# Camera Calibration and Subpixel Precision

[**Camera Calibration Post**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pirahansiah_camera-calibration-geometric-analysis-calibration-activity-7189576372879540225-z0Yk)

In this post, I delved into advanced methods of camera calibration, focusing on geometric analysis and calibration patterns using tools like **MATLAB**, **Python**, and **OpenCV**. I highlighted a **C++** algorithm implemented for high-speed, high-accuracy corner detection within calibration patterns, emphasizing rotation and orientation. The process was further refined using subpixel accuracy and noise reduction techniques, enhancing precision in computer vision applications.

### My Research About Camera Calibration

Geometric Analysis, Calibration Patterns, MATLAB, Python, C++, OpenCV, Subpixel Precision. A **C++** implemented algorithm was used for high-speed, high-accuracy corner detection within calibration patterns, focusing on rotation and orientation. The process was refined by subpixel accuracy and noise reduction techniques.

#### Camera Calibration

In computer vision methods, image information from cameras can yield geometric information pertaining to three-dimensional objects. The correlation between the topographical point and camera image pixel is necessary for camera calibration. Hence, the camera's parameters, which constitute the geometric model of camera imaging, are utilized to establish the association among the 3D geometric location of one point and its consistent point in an image. Typically, experiments are conducted to obtain the aforementioned parameters and relevant evaluation, which is a process called camera calibration.

#### Camera Calibration Methods

- **Active Vision Calibration**
- **Calibration with Known Object**

#### Key Concepts in Camera Calibration

- **Internal and External Parameters**: Calibration involves estimating these parameters to correct for lens distortion, measure object sizes, and position the camera within a scene.
- **Self-Calibration**: This method doesn't rely on specific calibration objects but utilizes the camera's movement through a scene to determine parameters.
- **Accuracy and Evaluation**: The accuracy of calibration depends on the construction tolerances of the calibration pattern and the quality of images used for calibration. Reprojection error is used as a qualitative measure of calibration accuracy.

#### Challenges and Innovations

- **Image Quality**: The quality of calibration images plays a crucial role. Techniques like the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) are used to assess image quality.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Advanced algorithms and optimization methods enhance calibration accuracy and efficiency.

#### Applications

- **Stereo Vision**: Fundamental for stereo vision systems, determining the accuracy of 3D scene reconstructions.
- **Robotics and Autonomous Vehicles**: Critical for navigation and object recognition tasks.
