### Tools
Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained (no external dependencies).
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- Minimize setup and maintenance.
- The core of Dear ImGui is self-contained within a few platform-agnostic files which you can easily compile in your application/engine. They are all the files in the root folder of the repository (imgui*.cpp, imgui*.h). No specific build process is required. You can add the .cpp files into your existing project.
- Backends for a variety of graphics API and rendering platforms are provided in the backends/ folder, along with example applications in the examples/ folder. You may also create your own backend. Anywhere where you can render textured triangles, you can render Dear ImGui.
