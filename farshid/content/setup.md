### Github tips:

- press "."
- ingest
    This cool library turns any GitHub repo into readable text for LLMs. You can do it in two ways:
        1.	Replace “hub” with “ingest” in the GitHub URL.
        2.	Go to https://github.com/cyclotruc/gitingest and paste your repo link.
    Example:
    GitHub repo: https://github.com/pirahansiah/workshop_LLM
    Ingest link: https://gitingest.com/pirahansiah/workshop_LLM
- Review
    To review a GitHub PR (Pull Request), you can simply add .diff to the end of the PR URL. Then copy that content and paste it into ChatGPT or Grok, and ask it to find bugs or suggest improvements.
    Example:
        1.	Suppose your PR link is:
    https://github.com/user/repo/pull/42
        2.	Add .diff to the end:
    https://github.com/user/repo/pull/42.diff
        3.	Open that link — you’ll see the raw code changes in diff format.
        4.	Copy the entire content.
        5.	Paste it into ChatGPT or Grok and ask:
    “Please review this PR for bugs or improvement suggestions.”
- GitSummarize
    Transform any GitHub repository into an AI-powered documentation hub.
    Pro tip: Replace hub with summarize in the GitHub URL.
    Example: https://github.com/user/repo → https://gitsummarize.com/user/repo
