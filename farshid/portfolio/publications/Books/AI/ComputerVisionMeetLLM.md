## Computer Vision Meets LLM: Multi-Agent Swarm with RAG for Images and Videos**

### **Introduction**

The convergence of Computer Vision (CV) and Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling more comprehensive and intelligent systems capable of understanding and interacting with the world in multimodal ways. By integrating multi-agent swarms with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), developers can create sophisticated applications that process and analyze images and videos alongside textual data. This synergy enhances capabilities in areas such as image recognition, video analysis, document processing, and interactive user experiences.

### **1. Integration of Computer Vision and Large Language Models**

Combining CV and LLMs leverages the strengths of both modalities:
- **Computer Vision** excels in interpreting and analyzing visual data, identifying patterns, objects, and actions within images and videos.
- **Large Language Models** (e.g., GPT-4) are proficient in understanding and generating human-like text, enabling nuanced interactions and contextual understanding.

Together, they enable applications that require both visual and textual comprehension, such as automated content creation, intelligent video summarization, and enhanced accessibility features.

### **2. Multi-Agent Swarm with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**

**Multi-Agent Swarms** involve multiple AI agents working collaboratively to perform complex tasks. When combined with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, these swarms can efficiently retrieve relevant information from diverse sources and generate contextually appropriate responses or actions.

- **RAG Mechanism**: Enhances LLMs by integrating a retrieval component that fetches relevant data from external sources (e.g., databases, documents, images) to inform the generation process.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Different agents specialize in various aspects of data processing (e.g., one handles image analysis, another manages textual data), ensuring comprehensive and efficient task execution.

### **3. Token Costs and Pricing for Image Processing with GPT-4 Turbo Vision**

OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo with Vision capabilities offers powerful tools for processing images and videos. Understanding the token costs associated with these operations is crucial for budgeting and optimizing usage.

#### **a. Low Mode**
- **Description**: Processes an image at a fixed cost, suitable for straightforward image analysis tasks.
- **Cost**: 85 tokens per image.

#### **b. High Mode**
- **Description**: Handles more complex images by resizing and partitioning them into manageable segments before processing.
- **Procedure**:
  1. **Scaling**: The image is scaled to fit within a 2048 x 2048 pixel square.
  2. **Resizing**: The shortest side of the image is resized to 768 pixels.
  3. **Partitioning**: The resized image is divided into multiple 512-pixel squares.
  4. **Cost Calculation**: 
     - **Base Cost**: 85 tokens.
     - **Additional Cost**: 170 tokens per 512-pixel square.
     - **Total Cost**: `(Number of squares * 170) + 85` tokens.
- **Example**: A 1080x1080 pixel image processed in vision mode costs approximately $0.00765 per image.

#### **c. Token Cost Management**
- **Tools**: Utilize AI Model Cost Calculators to estimate and manage token costs effectively.
