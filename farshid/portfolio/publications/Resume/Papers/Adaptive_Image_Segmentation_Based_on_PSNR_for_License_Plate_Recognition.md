# Adaptive Image Segmentation Based on PSNR for License Plate Recognition

## 1. Introduction
   - **Objective**: Propose an adaptive threshold method using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).
   - **Applications of Image Segmentation**:
     - License Plate Recognition (LPR)
     - Preprocessing in image analysis
     - Object detection and classification

## 2. Pattern Recognition
   - **Applications**:
     - Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
     - Biometrics (e.g., face, fingerprint recognition)
     - Medical diagnostics (e.g., X-ray analysis)
     - Military applications (e.g., Automated Target Recognition, Image Segmentation)

## 3. Motivation
   - **Thresholding**:
     - Single and multi-level thresholding methods
     - PSNR-based threshold for improved accuracy in segmentation
   - **Challenges**:
     - Differing environmental conditions (e.g., contrast, lighting)
     - Object complexity (e.g., fonts, colors, sizes)

## 4. Proposed Method
   - **PSNR as a Metric**:
     - Used to determine optimal threshold value
     - Evaluated across various test cases (dark, medium, bright images)
   - **Algorithm**:
     - Adaptive thresholding method steps:
       1. Calculate PSNR for different threshold values.
       2. Select the threshold value with the highest PSNR.
       3. Apply to image segmentation for license plate detection.
   
## 5. Multi-Level Thresholding
   - **Benefits**:
     - More accurate segmentation in complex images.
     - Used when single-threshold methods are insufficient.
   - **Algorithm Steps**:
     - Recursively apply PSNR to calculate the best multi-level thresholds.

## 6. Experimental Evaluation
   - **Comparison of Methods**:
     - PSNR-based method vs. existing methods:
       - Kittler and Illingworth’s MET
       - Potential Difference
       - Otsu's method
     - Results:
       - **Proposed method**: Reliable for high/low contrast situations (e.g., night, midday, rainy conditions).
   - **Performance Metrics**:
     - Accuracy in detecting license plates and characters
     - PSNR values across different threshold levels

## 7. Conclusion
   - **Key Findings**:
     - The proposed PSNR-based threshold method improves segmentation in license plate recognition.
     - Adaptive to changing environmental conditions (e.g., lighting, contrast).
     - Shows high reliability in experimental evaluations.
