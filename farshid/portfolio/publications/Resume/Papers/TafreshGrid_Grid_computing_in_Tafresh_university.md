This paper introduces TafreshGrid, a grid computing project developed at Azad University, Tafresh branch. The aim is to coordinate distributed computing resources to create a virtual system capable of solving large-scale computational problems across multiple institutions.

The project is implemented in three phases, starting with the setup of the grid infrastructure at Tafresh University, followed by its expansion to other branches of Azad University , and finally connecting it to a national grid computing network. Key software tools, including the Globus Toolkit, are used to manage the grid computing tasks.

The project demonstrates the successful installation of the grid computing environment, with plans to extend the project for solving national computational challenges that require high-performance computing.
