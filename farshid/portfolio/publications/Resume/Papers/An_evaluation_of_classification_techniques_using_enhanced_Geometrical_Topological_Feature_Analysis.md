# An Evaluation of Classification Techniques Using Enhanced Geometrical Topological Feature Analysis

## 1. Introduction
   - **Objective**: Evaluation of classification techniques for the Malaysian License Plate Recognition (LPR) system.
   - **Applications of LPR**:
     - Law enforcement
     - Border protection
     - Vehicle theft detection
     - Automatic toll collection
     - Traffic control

## 2. Image Classification Techniques
   - **Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS)**:
     - Mimics biological immune systems for pattern recognition.
   - **Neural Networks (NN)**:
     - Machine learning technique that models the human brain to classify images.
   - **Bayesian Networks (BN)**:
     - Probabilistic graphical models to classify data based on probability distributions.
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
     - Uses geometric representations to classify data.

## 3. Enhanced Geometrical Topological Feature Analysis
   - **Proposed Approach**:
     - Focuses on improving image classification accuracy for Malaysian license plates.
     - Uses topological features from license plate characters and numbers.
   - **Input Features**:
     - Character shapes
     - Geometrical features

## 4. Classification Error Analysis
   - **Character Error Analysis**:
     - Errors analyzed based on classification methods.
     - Provides insights into which methods perform better in specific conditions.

## 5. Results
   - **Best Performing Technique**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Outperforms AIRS, Neural Networks, and Bayesian Networks in accuracy for Malaysian LPR.
   - **Performance Factors**:
     - Environmental conditions (weather, lighting)
     - Character variability (font, size)

## 6. Conclusion
   - **Summary**: SVM provides the most accurate classification for the Malaysian LPR system.
   - **Implications**: Improved reliability for law enforcement, toll collection, and traffic control systems.
