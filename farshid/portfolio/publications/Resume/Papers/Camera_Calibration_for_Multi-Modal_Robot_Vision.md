# Camera Calibration for Multi-Modal Robot Vision

## 1. Introduction
   - **Objective**: Propose an automatic calibration method for multimodal robot vision.
   - **Challenges in Robot Vision**:
     - Image quality degradation
     - Difficulty in adjusting to different environments
   - **Key Issues**:
     - False negative data points due to poor calibration
     - Need for continuous recalibration in dynamic environments

## 2. Image Quality and Calibration
   - **Image Quality Assessment (IQA)**:
     - Impact of poor image quality on robot vision
     - Key metrics:
       - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
       - Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
   - **Camera Calibration (CC)**:
     - Relationship between image quality and calibration accuracy
     - Need for automatic calibration techniques

## 3. Proposed Method
   - **Automatic Calibration Framework**:
     - Framework based on IQA metrics like PSNR and SSIM
     - Designed to adjust calibration automatically in real-time as image quality changes
   - **Calibration Techniques**:
     - Techniques for handling dynamic environments and maintaining accuracy
     - Evaluates multiple environments to test robustness

## 4. Evaluation and Results
   - **Accuracy Evaluation**:
     - Comparison of calibration methods in different test scenarios
     - Analysis of datasets generated with automatic calibration
   - **Results**:
     - Significant improvement in robot vision accuracy using the proposed automatic calibration method
     - Less need for manual intervention in real-time environments

## 5. Conclusion
   - **Key Findings**:
     - The proposed method successfully addresses the challenge of automatic camera calibration in dynamic environments.
     - Demonstrates a clear link between image quality assessment and calibration performance.
   - **Implications**:
     - Improved robot vision performance in various applications (e.g., autonomous humanoid robots).
