# GSFT-PSNR: Global Single Fuzzy Threshold Based on PSNR for OCR Systems

## Abstract
Binarization or thresholding is a critical step in computer vision and image analysis, particularly in applications such as OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and augmented reality. This method separates the foreground from the background in an image, reducing the amount of data to process and improving computational efficiency. Traditional methods like Otsu’s thresholding are compared to a new method called GSFT-PSNR, which uses Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and fuzzy logic to determine threshold values. The proposed method shows improvements in various real-world applications such as license plate recognition and handwritten image processing.

## Keywords
- **Single fuzzy thresholding method**
- **Image segmentation**
- **OCR**
- **Threshold algorithm**
- **Adaptive image binarization**
- **Augmented reality**

## Introduction
Thresholding is a key first step in many computer vision applications, crucial for object recognition, camera calibration, and reducing noise. While single-level thresholding is fast and effective, multilevel thresholding can lead to higher computational time. Global thresholding methods are often favored for their speed, while local thresholding techniques are necessary for more complex scenes.

## Key Contributions
The proposed method, GSFT-PSNR, combines global single fuzzy thresholding with PSNR to improve performance in varied lighting and environmental conditions. It is designed to adapt to different ambient illuminations and applications, such as OCR and license plate recognition. GSFT-PSNR excels in handling unstructured environments with variable lighting.

## Materials and Methods

### 1. One Level Thresholding
- Single thresholding (binary image conversion).
- Faster computation due to fewer levels.
- Equation (1) governs the transformation to binary based on a threshold value.

### 2. Multilevel Thresholding
- Multilevel methods for more detailed images (grayscale images).
- More computationally intensive but captures a greater range of pixel values.

### 3. Proposed Method
- Uses PSNR as an indicator for determining the threshold value.
- Fuzzy logic refines the threshold value based on the average intensity value (AIV).
- Steps include calculating PSNR for a range of thresholds, selecting the minimum PSNR, and applying the fuzzy system.

### PSNR Equation
\[ PSNR = 10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{MAX^2}{MSE}\right) \]  
Where `MAX` is the maximum pixel value, and `MSE` is the mean square error between the original and thresholded image.

## Results and Discussion
- The proposed method is compared to traditional methods such as Otsu, Max Entropy, and others.
- Benchmark tests using the DIBCO 2013 dataset show that GSFT-PSNR outperforms Otsu’s method in many cases, particularly in handwritten document recognition and varying lighting conditions.

## Conclusion
The GSFT-PSNR method offers a robust, adaptive thresholding approach that can handle challenging real-world scenarios with varying lighting and complex scenes. By using PSNR as a quality measure and combining it with fuzzy logic, the method improves upon traditional thresholding techniques in OCR and other computer vision tasks.
