# Ant Colony Optimization for Image Edge Detection

## 1. Introduction
- **Thresholding**: Used in various computer vision applications like OCR, image segmentation, and object tracking.
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Population-based metaheuristic for optimization.
- **Objective**: Combining ACO, edge detection, and thresholding for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems.

## 2. State of the Art
### 2.1 Thresholding Methods
- **Categories**: Single, Multilevel, Multi-thresholding
- **Single Thresholding**: Converts the image into binary (black and white).
  - **Pirahansiah's Single Threshold Method**: A custom single threshold method using PSNR.
- **Multilevel Thresholding**: Separates objects based on gray values using multiple thresholds.
- **Multi-threshold**: Uses multiple threshold values to identify objects in images.

### 2.2 Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- **Introduction**: Initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992 for combinatorial optimization problems.
- **Application**: Used for image edge detection in this paper.
- **Process**:
  1. Initialize ants randomly.
  2. Move ants based on probability and pheromone updates.
  3. Update pheromone values for optimization.
  
## 3. Proposed Method
- **Combining ACO and Thresholding**: ACO is applied to enhance image thresholding in OCR systems.
- **Comparison**: The proposed method is compared with Otsu, Kittler, Illingworth, and Pirahansiah's methods.

## 4. Results and Discussion
- **Datasets**: DIBCO 2009 benchmark, including printed and handwritten images.
- **Performance**: The proposed ACO-based method shows better PSNR results for thresholding compared to traditional methods.
- **Comparison Results**: The ACO method outperforms others in printed and handwritten datasets.

## 5. Conclusion
- **Effective for OCR**: The ACO-based thresholding method improves the edge detection and thresholding for OCR systems.
- **Future Work**: Optimizing ACO parameters for better performance in different types of images.
