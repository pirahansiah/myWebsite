#### Camera Calibration

##### 1. Introduction
Geometric camera calibration, also referred to as camera resectioning, estimates the parameters of a lens and image sensor of an image or video camera. These parameters can be used to correct lens distortion, measure the size of an object in world units, or determine the location of the camera in the scene. Applications include:
- Machine vision for detecting and measuring objects.
- Robotics for navigation systems and 3D scene reconstruction.

##### 2. Camera Calibration Methods

###### 2.1 Self-Calibration Methods
Self-calibration, or auto-calibration methods, do not rely on a calibration reference object. These methods have been enhanced by using active vision, where specific camera motions, such as pure rotation or orthogonal translations, are designed to improve accuracy. However, practical application of these methods is hindered by the difficulty in achieving pure camera rotation around the optical center.

###### Advantages:
- No pre-processing is required.
- Useful in environments where calibration objects cannot be placed.

###### Disadvantages:
- Low accuracy and high complexity.
- Sensitive to noise and difficult to implement.

###### 2.2 Active Vision-Based Calibration
Active vision calibration involves the camera performing specific movements under controlled conditions. The method allows for numerous images to be taken during controlled motion, which helps estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera. The calibration based on three orthogonal translational motions is particularly useful.

###### Advantages:
- Medium complexity.
- Requires images of patterns in controlled environments.

###### Disadvantages:
- Requires additional hardware for controlled motion.
- Moderate accuracy.

###### 2.3 Calibration with Known Object (Traditional Methods)
The most common method of camera calibration involves the use of a known object, like a chessboard, to compute the camera’s internal and external parameters. Images of the object at different orientations are taken, and transformations are applied to extract the required parameters.

###### Popular Methods:
- **Tsai’s Method (1987):** This involves a two-step calibration using known 2D patterns.
- **Zhang’s Method (2000):** This method uses plane images (like chessboard patterns) to compute radial distortion and other camera parameters.

###### Advantages:
- High accuracy with just a few calibration images.
- Widely used in libraries like OpenCV and Matlab.

###### Disadvantages:
- Requires prior knowledge of the calibration object and precise measurements.

##### 3. Factors Affecting Calibration Accuracy

###### 3.1 Image Quality
Calibration accuracy is contingent on the quality of input images. High-quality images with minimal blurring are essential for accurate camera calibration. Factors such as image sharpness, defocus, and motion blur can negatively affect calibration results.

###### 3.2 Control Points
Camera calibration accuracy also depends on the precise location of control points in an image. Blurring, distortion, and incorrect feature extraction can lead to inaccurate results.

##### 4. Zhang’s Camera Calibration Method
Zhang’s method is one of the most widely used techniques for camera calibration. It uses multiple images of a 2D calibration pattern (like a chessboard) to determine both the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera.

###### Key Steps:
1. **Homography Calculation:** Using the Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) method, the projection matrix between the calibration target and image plane is estimated.
2. **Self-Calibration Techniques:** These techniques are used to compute the absolute conic matrix from the images.
3. **Optimization:** Non-linear optimization using the maximum likelihood criterion is applied to compute the final values of camera parameters.

##### 5. Additional Methods
- **Type-2 Fuzzy-Based Camera Calibration:** This method introduces the use of fuzzy logic for selecting high-quality images during the calibration process. It consists of two main steps: Auto Pre-Setting Dependent Parameters (APSDP) and Fuzzy Image Acquisition Collecting Operation (FIACO).

- **Ferstl's Method:** This method involves learning depth calibration for time-of-flight cameras using a novel calibration target where feature points are detected automatically at sub-pixel accuracy.

##### 6. Calibration Target and Patterns
Several calibration targets can be used for camera calibration, including:
- **Chessboard Patterns**
- **Planar Conics**
- **1D Target Grids**
These targets serve as a reference to accurately compute the camera's parameters.

##### 7. Conclusion
Camera calibration is crucial for applications like 3D reconstruction, object inspection, and navigation. Proper calibration methods, such as those involving known objects, can greatly enhance the accuracy of a camera system's measurements and improve its overall performance.
