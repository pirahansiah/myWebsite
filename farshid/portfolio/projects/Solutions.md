## Camera Calibration Expertise

I am an expert in **camera calibration**, with several publications, applications, and solutions developed around this area. My work spans both **single-camera** and **multi-camera systems**, where I have experience with a range of calibration techniques, from **simple fixed patterns** (like chessboards) to more **complex, automated calibration methods**.

### Expertise Areas:
- **Standard RGB cameras**: Calibration for common imaging tasks.
- **High-resolution cameras**: Used in industries requiring precision and high-detail imaging.
- **Depth cameras**: Calibration for **stereo vision systems**, and **3D reconstruction**.
- **Infrared cameras**: Applied to thermal imaging, night vision, and more.
- **IoT-connected camera systems**: Solutions for real-time monitoring and **smart environments**.
- **Robotic vision systems**: Integrating multiple camera feeds for dynamic environments like **autonomous navigation** and **industrial robotics**.
- **Medical imaging systems**: Precise calibration for tools 

### Calibration Techniques:
- **Fixed calibration patterns**: Using methods like chessboards for simpler applications.
- **Dynamic and automated calibration**: Solutions tailored for real-time and mobile platforms, allowing cameras to adapt to changing environments.
  
I have worked with various industries such as **robotics**, **IoT**, **medical technology**, and **industrial automation**, providing robust calibration solutions that ensure accuracy across multiple environments and platforms.

# cvtest: Computer Vision Test

**Unit Test, Integration Test, System Test, Acceptance Test for Computer Vision and Deep Learning**

Do you want to test the output of your computer vision application, whether it's video or images?  
In computer vision development, there are no standard tests readily available, so Iâ€™ve created and shared a few.

## Key Features:
- **Standard Tests for Computer Vision Applications**: Since no official standards exist, Iâ€™ve written custom tests to check processing time, memory usage, CPU usage, and more.
- **Output Validation**: For image-based applications, Iâ€™ve developed tests that compare output images to ground truth, using methods like **PSNR**, **SSIM**, and other image quality metrics (e.g., distortion, brightness, sharpness).
- **Hardware-Specific Tests**: Iâ€™ve also written tests for different hardware architectures to evaluate their impact on performance.
- **Common Questions Solved**:
  - Does your program adjust image brightness automatically and correctly?
  - Is your generic sharpening kernel removing blurriness effectively?
  - How do you check **FPS (frames per second)** for image processing?
  - Which **OCR system** works best for your input image?

Find more details in the [README file](https://github.com/pirahansiah/cvtest/blob/main/README.md) on GitHub.
