# cvtest: Computer Vision Test

**Unit Test, Integration Test, System Test, Acceptance Test for Computer Vision and Deep Learning**

Do you want to test the output of your computer vision application, whether it's video or images?  
In computer vision development, there are no standard tests readily available, so I’ve created and shared a few.

## Key Features:
- **Standard Tests for Computer Vision Applications**: Since no official standards exist, I’ve written custom tests to check processing time, memory usage, CPU usage, and more.
- **Output Validation**: For image-based applications, I’ve developed tests that compare output images to ground truth, using methods like **PSNR**, **SSIM**, and other image quality metrics (e.g., distortion, brightness, sharpness).
- **Hardware-Specific Tests**: I’ve also written tests for different hardware architectures to evaluate their impact on performance.
- **Common Questions Solved**:
  - Does your program adjust image brightness automatically and correctly?
  - Is your generic sharpening kernel removing blurriness effectively?
  - How do you check **FPS (frames per second)** for image processing?
  - Which **OCR system** works best for your input image?

Find more details in the [README file](https://github.com/pirahansiah/cvtest/blob/main/README.md) on GitHub.
